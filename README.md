### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- Drag and drop tasks to re-order them in a column or move them in different column
- Keep track of any changes after refreshing the browser

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Object Oriented JavaScript
- JS Class as Component - same methodology as my previous project [Job listing](https://github.com/jeanwll/static-job-listings-master)
- [ArrowJS](https://www.arrow-js.com/) - Reactive UI with native JavaScript

## Design additions and adaptation

I took the initiative to rework a few of the provided rules and layout.

### Column Dialog

Current requirement mentions that new columns should be created through the edit board modal, which I thought was really not an intuitive behavior; clicking "New Column" would display a form where the first field is "Board Title".
I created a simple form dedicated to form creation/edition, and additionally providing color selection for each columns.

### Sticky Column Name

### New Column Button

### Small screen without boards

### Dialog menu position

### Custom Dialog Select

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
